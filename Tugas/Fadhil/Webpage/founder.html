        <h1>My History</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            I was born in Jakarta 6th May 2001, at Rumah Sakit Haji. After i was born, i had to go to Padang because my father had to work there. My mother told me that one month after i was born
            we had to go to Padang with a ferry, and what made me excited is that the weather that day was so teribble. It rained very hard. The storm was so big, the waves are heavy. Fortunately, we can arrive safely.
            This is where i grew up, i met a very kind person, that is my neighbors. Taci and Angah. They are very kind, even though i was so naughty back there. In my Fifth birthday, i had to go to Bengkulu because of the same reason. 
            I started my studies at a Kindergarten in Bengkulu. But it was only for a couple of months before i moved to Bekasi, my home right now. I went to Poncol Elementary School in Bekasi until the 3rd Grade, but then again i had to move to my new Elementary School In Jakarta.
            My years in 05 Cipayung Elementary School was really good, i got 27.5 in National Exam and applied in 272 Junior Highschool. So after that i began my life in Junior Highschool as a scout member. Even though i already interested in Scout at Elementary School, but the most active activity was in Junior Highschool.
